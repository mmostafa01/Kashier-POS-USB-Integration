# Integration Documentation: Windows PC and Android POS Machine Communication

## Overview

This technical documentation provides guidelines for integrating a Windows PC and an Android POS Machine through a USB connection. The purpose of this integration is to enable the transfer of a stringified JSON data payload from the PC to the POS Machine and receive a response as a stringified JSON from the POS Machine back to the PC. The integration will utilize USB communication protocols and APIs to establish a reliable data transfer mechanism using UTF-8 encoding and byte array conversion.

## Integration Steps

The integration process involves multiple steps to establish communication between the Windows PC and the Android POS Machine. These steps include setting up the development environment, implementing the necessary code on both sides, and handling data transfer. Follow the steps below to complete the integration:

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

#### Windows PC:

1. Create a new Windows application project or open an existing project in your preferred development environment.
2. Install the necessary USB libraries or packages required for USB communication. This might vary depending on the programming language or framework you are using.
3. Implement the necessary code to detect the connected POS Machine and establish a USB connection.
4. Implement read and write operations to send the stringified JSON payload to the POS Machine and receive the response as a stringified JSON.

### 2. Data Transfer

Once the USB connection is successfully established, you can proceed with the data transfer process between the PC and the POS Machine:

#### PC to POS Machine:

1. build your payload in a JSON Scheme then Stringify it.
   ```json
    {
     "amount": "200.33",
     "currency": "EGP",
     "action_type": "SALE"
    }
3. Convert the stringified JSON payload to a byte array on the PC.
4. Send the byte array to the POS Machine through the USB connection.
5. The POS Machine should receive the byte array.
6. Then convert the received byte array back to a stringified JSON using UTF-8 encoding.

#### POS Machine to PC:

1. receive the serialized response object from the POS Machine and convert it to a JSON.
   ```json
    {
      "rsp_code":0,
      "rsp_msg":"SUCCESS",
      "receipt_payload":{
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
3. Stringify it.
4. Convert the stringified JSON from the POS Machine to a byte array.
5. Send the byte array response from the POS Machine to the PC through the USB connection.
6. Implement the necessary code on the PC to receive the byte array response.
7. Convert the received byte array back to a stringified JSON using UTF-8 encoding.

## Conclusion

This integration documentation provides an overview of the steps involved in integrating a Windows PC and an Android POS Machine through USB communication. It guides you through the setup of the development environment, implementation of the necessary code, and the data transfer process. By following these steps, you can establish a reliable communication channel between the PC and the POS Machine, facilitating the exchange of stringified JSON data payloads.
